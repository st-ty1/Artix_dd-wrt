- Support for lto is not working with these patches at the moment. Needs an additional link within toolchain and a modification of the patch of common.mk. 
     -> Already tested, will be uploaded soon.
- Correct building of some of the external kernel modules in Makefile.brcm3x and Makefile.northstar needs some amendments. 
     -> Already tested, will be uploaded as updated patch, too.
- DD-WRT has included python3.8. As Artix already uses python 3.10 and cross-compiling of python3.8 needs exactly python3.8 on host, a native version of python3.8 has to be built, too. 
     -> Has to inserted in python mk.
