Necessary packages for building dd-wrt on Artix are:
make, gcc, which, autoconf, automake, pkgconf, patch, bison, flex, cmake, rpcsvc-proto, gperf, python, intltool,
svn, gtk-doc, bc, gengetopt, talloc, re2c, python-pip, python2, ninja and squashfs-tools.

The precompiled 32-bit host-tools of FT need following packages: lib32-glibc, lib32-gcc-libs and lib32-zlib
(Therefore, don't forget to uncomment the lines of the "lib32" section in /etc/pacman.conf).
